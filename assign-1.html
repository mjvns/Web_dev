		<p>A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the web as a 
			medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A web page tells the great story with great graphical and analytical 
			presentation.<br/>
		   Using the <q>View</q> option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system
			that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black.
			I could have just written in <q>white</q> and <q>black</q> instead of these codes.<br/>
			Here is an example of a horizontal rule:<br/>
			<hr>
			To begin we can change the <br/>
			<h5>
				<font size="4">header size</font>
			</h5>
			and <font color="blue">color</font> <font color="red">of</font> <font color="green">letter</font> seen on the screen.The <font size="10">font size</font> can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.We can also change the appearance
			of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote.<br/>
			<pre>		Now is the <i>time</i> for all good <b>people</b> to <b>come</b> to the <i>aid</i> of their country</pre>
			<kbd>That was also an example of a nested command.</kbd>
